 <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
 <p style="width:900px;margin-left:40px;"> <strong>It is a long</strong> established fact that a reader will be <mark>distracted</mark> by the 
 readable content of a page when looking at its layout.   The point of
 	  using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal<del> distribution </del>of 
 	  letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',  making it 
 	  look like readable English.  Many desktop publishing packages and web 
 	  page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,  and a 
 	  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in   their 
 	  infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,  sometimes by 
 	  accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like</p><br>

 	  <p style="width:900px">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
